This repo creates a number of blank images for a couple of ARM dev boards.
These images have the necessary partitions, sizes and filesystem - but not actual files.

Currently there is the following image:

* `rpi-raw-image` with two partitions (FAT + EXT4) for the Raspberry Pi
* `odroid-raw-image` with two partitions (FAT + EXT4) for ODROID (eg. XU4)
